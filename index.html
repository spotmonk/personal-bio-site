    Hi! I'm Geno McNew! I'd been teaching myself to code for a little over a year and then started Nashville Software School with the hopes of learning what I don't know I don't know. I've been working for a rent-to-own company for a few years and I've written a number of programs to make my job there easier. Most of these programs contain proprietary information, but in general I've written bots for discord and slack. I've also written a tampermonkey scripts that consolidate info from a page as well as pull information from our website's api so all the the information I need for a sale is at the my fingertips. I also wrote a program that takes this information I pulled together with the tampermonkey script and returns a PDF file of a lease for the customer to sign. The leases vary depending on state and frequency of payment and the application handles all that information.
